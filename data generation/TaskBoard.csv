"Language Model of Phylogenetic Trees","2024-12-31 09:00:00.000000+00","This project will involve building a language model of phylogenetic trees. The model will be trained on a large corpus of phylogenetic trees, and will be used to generate new trees. The model will be evaluated by comparing the generated trees to a test set of trees. The project will involve implementing a language model, and evaluating the model on a test set of gene trees."
